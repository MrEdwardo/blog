Germany is notoriously hostile when it comes to bureaucracy. When I moved to Berlin a few years ago, by far the most overwhelming part of the move (other than starting a new job and life) was the hoops I had to jump through in order to do things “officially” and get set up as a resident.

The language barrier is definitely a big part of the friction (which is primarily my own fault, I know). I should have got to grips with some basic German before arriving to start my new Berliner life. The problem is that the way things are done here make for an unnecessarily-hostile experience for non-German speakers. Most of the official processes are done on paper (goodbye copy-paste into Google Translate!) or require making appointments at official offices where German is often the only language spoken.

Despite all of this, there are a few tech-focused products which have emerged in the last couple of years that truly feel like they’re cutting through said bureaucracy, and throwing a way a lot of useless complexity. On top of this, some of them are just outright enjoyable to use. They increase my efficiency and make me feel superhuman. And I want to share them with you.

# Superhuman banking

Berlin is home of FinTech startup N26 (formerly Number26). The value proposition of N26 is clear: They’re building a modern bank account for the next generation of user — one that’s entirely based around the smartphone. There are a number of “startup” bank accounts today — I simply ended up using N26 because they were first to launch here in Germany, and I have a couple of friends working at their Berlin HQ.

*After dealing with traditional banks, the experience of using N26 is really refreshing.*

The main benefits of N26 for me are:

- Everything can be managed inside the app
- Instant push notifications for transactions
- Use any ATM for cash, for free* (this was NOT a thing in Germany, and still isn’t for most banks)
- Free MasterCard debit card (most bank accounts in Germany STILL require you to pay for anything more than a Maestro card!)
- No stupid fees for foreign transactions

*Note: N26 has now added a limit to the number of free withdrawals per month. But it still beats most “traditional” banks in this regard.*

# Superhuman travel with mobility startups

In all honesty, public transport is pretty good in Berlin. It’s basically the anti-Los-Angeles (sorry LA, I love you really), where you really don’t need a car to get by, and almost everywhere is reachable within 30 mins using a combination of underground (U-bahn), overground (S-bahn), tram and bus. Even better, you can do all of that with a single ticket.

So you might be surprised to hear that mobility startups in Berlin are making transport even more efficient, pushing journey times and convenience to the extreme. And it’s amazing!

## Coup

Coup is an electric scooter service run by Bosch. They’ve saturated the entire city’s streets with Gogoro e-scooters that are easily accessible through their mobile app. You can ride for up to 30 mins for 3 Euros, and then park and log off basically anywhere you like. Most journeys are less than 30 mins. This is THE fastest way to get around the city, with very few exceptions.

Coup uses electric scooters from Gogoro that feel like futuristic robots. Honestly.

## Emmy 

Emmy (formerly eMio) is an electric scooter service similar to Coup. Emmy actually arrived on the scene first, but honestly the experience isn’t quite as smooth. The scooters also don’t quite match the level of enjoyment of Coup’s incredible Gogoro scooters. The nice thing is though, you can use both for even better coverage! You’re never more than a couple of minutes away from a Coup or an Emmy.

## Car2Go

Car2Go is a subsiduary of Daimler AG, and offers car sharing in a similar way to the above scooter services. Becuse it’s Daimler (who owns Mercedes and SMART), all cars are either SMART or Mercedes. Price is per-minute, or you can buy a bigger multi-hour package if you want more time. Again, you can park almost anywhere, which is the key thing with these services. The moment you have to end your journey in a specific spot, the usefulness goes way down.

## DriveNow

DriveNow is basically Car2Go but run in partnership with BMW and Sixt. And you guessed it, the cars are all BMWs (inc. Mini) of varying sizes and cost-per-minute.

DriveNow has a lot of different car models available. The cabriolet versions are a nice touch for that sunny evening ;) (source: https://www.drive-now.com/de/de)

Last but not least, Lidl Bike is a mobility service for those who prefer their mode of transport to burn significant calories. It’s run in partnership between Lidl and Deutsche Bahn.

Honestly, the service isn’t the easiest to use in term of user experience — especially when you compare it with the other mobility services above. But once you’re signed up it’s quite easy to rent a bike, and there are bikes spread all over the city. With 30 mins costing 1.50 EUR (or 1.00 EUR if you return the bike at a “bike station”), it’s really cheap.

They’re kind of ugly, even with a fake sunset backdrop. (source: http://lidl-bike.de)

With the above services, the options are endless for getting to your destination:

- Weather’s good? Take a Coup.
- 👫 Got two people? Take an Emmy.
- 🚴🏻 Want some exercise? Take a Lidl bike.
- 🌧 Raining? Take a Car2Go.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Got the whole family? Take a bigger Car2Go or DriveNow.
- 🎒 Day trip? Buy a whole day package for Car2Go.
- 🛫 Airport trip? You can log off your Car2Go or DriveNow at the airport.

Or you can even mix up a combination of public transport and the above services! I’m constantly optimizing my journey time and cost in this way.

# Superhuman snail mail

DigitalKasten is a relatively new weapon in my arsenal of superhuman services, but so far I’m really liking it.

DigitalKasten is a startup which allows you to receive your snail mail digitally. As I mentioned at the top of the post, there’s still a ton of correspondence in Germany that just has to happen through 🐌 mail. In addition to this, I’ve found that you need to respond quickly to some things, whether bills or other official notices. If you spend a lot of time traveling, this sucks! Nothing’s worse than coming home to a collection of overdue bills that you’re now required to pay a fine for!

Getting your 🐌 mail digitally is a really nice experience! (source: https://www.digitalkasten.de)

DigitalKasten basically forwards all of your normal mail (except packages) to their secure handling center, where it’s scanned and pushed to an inbox directly in their app. While there are definitely still a few things to smooth out with the product (they’re just getting started, it’s still German-only etc.), I’m certain it’ll save me a lot of grief when I’m travelling.

# What makes these superhuman?

The services I listed above each bring a set of benefits that help make life more efficient and pleasant. But when used in combination, the result is a lifestyle that’s truly augmented by technology, giving you more time in your life to focus on… well, the things you want to focus on.

Did I miss something here? What apps and services do you use that give you that “superhuman” feeling? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
